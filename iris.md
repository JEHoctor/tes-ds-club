# Iris dataset fact sheet

![iris flower measurements](iris.png)

This is one of the earliest datasets used to study “classification.”
It was made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper _The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems_.
The dataset describes examples of three species of iris flowers, and for each example it lists four measurements of the shape of the flower.
The measurements are called “sepal length,” “sepal width,” “petal length,” and “petal width.”
All of the measurements are in centimeters.

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width | Label            |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| 5.4          | 3.4         | 1.7          | 0.2         | Iris-setosa      |
| 5.0          | 2.0         | 3.5          | 1.0         | Iris-versicolor  |
| 5.8          | 2.7         | 4.1          | 1.0         | Iris-versicolor  |
| 6.2          | 2.8         | 4.8          | 1.8         | Iris-virginica   |
| 5.9          | 3.0         | 5.1          | 1.8         | Iris-virginica   |


_How can we use these four measurements to tell these species apart?_
